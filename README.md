# Little Computer 3 Patt & Patel Project 

## Overview
This project implements a simplified version of the Little Computer 3 (LC-3) architecture using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). The LC-3 is a minimalistic educational computer architecture designed for teaching the fundamentals of computer organization and architecture. This VHDL implementation provides a hands-on approach to understanding digital logic design, sequential circuits, and computer architecture concepts.

## Features
### LC-3 Instruction Set: 
Supports a subset of the LC-3 instruction set including arithmetic, logic, control flow, and data movement instructions.
Memory System: Implements memory components such as instruction memory and data memory, providing storage for both program instructions and data. MENSAH_LC3
#### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): 
Executes arithmetic and logic operations on data according to the instruction set. MENAH_DATA_PATH
#### Control Unit: 
Orchestrates the execution of instructions by controlling the flow of data between various components of the LC-3. MENAH_DATA_PATH.vhd
#### I/O Interfaces: 
Interfaces for input and output operations, allowing interaction with external devices such as displays, keyboards, or other peripherals.
Usage MENSAH_LC3.vhd
#### Simulation: 
Simulate the behavior of the LC-3 design using VHDL simulation tools such as ModelSim or GHDL. MENSAH_TB_LC3.vhd
